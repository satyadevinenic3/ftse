1,HUST Bearing Dataset,"Provides a large set of vibration data on different ball bearings. This dataset contains 99 raw vibration signals of 6 types of defects (inner crack, outer crack, ball crack, and their 2-combinations) on 5 types of bearing (6204, 6205, 6206, 6207, and 6208) at 3 working conditions (0 W, 200 W, and 400 W). Each vibration signal is sampled at a rate of 51,200 samples per second for 10 s.",https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/cbv7jyx4p9/3,"In the HUST bearing dataset, each vibration sample is captured at a fixed sampling frequency fs (e.g., 51,200 Hz = 51k samples were taken per second. Therefore, time gap bw samples=1/fs). Using this sampling rate, we can construct a continuous time vector by assigning each data point a time based on its sample index."
2,Air Data: Air Quality Data Collected at Outdoor Monitors Across the US,"queries daily air quality summary statistics for the criteria pollutants by monitor. You can get data for specific monitors or all monitors in a city, county, or state.  ",https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data,"The data is distributed across multiple layers: Year, chemical pollutant, state, county, and site. So, we're modeling it: pollutant/ year/ state and the individual sites are grouped together to form unique keys. "
3,Air quality pattern data,,https://github.com/zhouxu-ds/air-quality-pattern-recognition/blob/main/data/SL132001-data%20(12).csv,The data is taken from the months of May and June 2020. It has minute wise readings of various air particles.
4,NASA Turbofan Jet Engine dataset,"Data sets consists of multiple multivariate time series. Each data set is further divided into training and test subsets. Each time series is from a different engine i.e., the data can be considered to be from a fleet of engines of the same type. ",https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps/data,"Time series data for each engine is available with 3 types of operational settings and 21 engine specific features like Duct pressure, temperature, fan speed, core speed, etc. "
5,HASC Challenge2011,HASC (Human Activity Sensing Consortium) is aimed at achieving the recognition and understanding of human activity through sensing.,http://hasc.jp/hc2011/dataFormat-en.html,"Human movement activities are tracked and captured in enviromnents like buildings, elevators, escalators, and floors using Acclerometers and gyrometers. For each human activity and timestamp the data is distributed across the 3D co-ordinate plane: x,y, and z axis. "
6,Sleep-EDF Database,"The sleep-edf database contains 197 whole-night PolySomnoGraphic sleep recordings, containing EEG, EOG, chin EMG, and event markers. Some records also contain respiration and body temperature. Corresponding hypnograms (sleep patterns) were manually scored by well-trained technicians according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales manual, and are also available.",https://www.physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/sleep-telemetry/#files-panel,"The data has 4 features: EEG (from Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz electrode locations), EOG (horizontal), and submental chin EMG. The experiments are conducted on healthy[SC- Sleep Cassette] and sleep disorder affected[ST- Sleep Telemetry] patients. "
7,Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones,Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones,"The data is extracted from 3 sensors: Accelerometer and gyroscope attached to the body and the total accelerometer. For each of them, x,y,z coordinates are stored in a time series sequence. "
8,Earth Observation Nightlight data,Analysis-ready dataset of monthly nighttime lights derived from the VIIRS instrument aboard the SNPP satellite.,https://github.com/eoatlas/nightlight/tree/main,The nightlight[Number of pixels and average number of cloud-free observations per pixel] data is aggregated monthly for each state across the globe.
